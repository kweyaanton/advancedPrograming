This Django-based project implements a secure data management system with input and retrieval functionalities, incorporating robust security measures based on threat modeling and adhering to the specifications outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.


Project Title: Secure Data Management System with Django
Overview:
This project aims to implement a secure data management system using Django, providing functionalities for inputting data into a database and retrieving information. The system adheres to the specifications outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, ensuring a robust and secure architecture.

Features:
Data Input Page:

Accessible through [Input Page URL], this page allows users to securely input data into the system. The Django framework ensures data validation and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities.
Data Retrieval Page:

Accessible through [Retrieval Page URL], this page enables users to retrieve information from the database. The retrieval process is designed to be efficient and secure, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.
Security Measures:

The system incorporates security measures based on threat modeling, utilizing the DREAD, Threat Trees, and STRIDE methods. Critical areas identified in the threat modeling process have been protected to mitigate potential security threats.
Django Framework:

Built on the Django web framework, the system benefits from its robust features, including the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, built-in authentication, and ORM for seamless database interaction.
Assumptions:

The system makes reasonable assumptions about the requirements and design based on the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. Assumptions are documented and justified in the codebase.
Getting Started:
